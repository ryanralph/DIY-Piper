From 1.01 to 1.02:
	Updated bitaddress.org to latest 2.5.2 version which includes BIP0038 Support
	Implemented BIP0038 as an option for printing encrypted paper wallets
	Brought in zimage's bitcoin-python-library
	Added dialog boxes for error messages which were previously only showing up in the terminal and were therefore useless to the end user


From 1.02 to 1.03:
	Fixed bug in main Piper daemon that was caused by the RPi.GPIO Python Event library.  The bug could cause Piper to register a button press when the remember/forget switch was switched.
	Added Litecoin logo image for Litecoin paper wallets contributed by a Piper user
	Added bitcoinpaperwallet.com html page for users who desire to use it with their own printers

From 1.03 to 1.04:
	Fixed printing so that paper wallets now print in one smooth motion.

From 1.04 to 1.05:
	Removed the ability to use BIP0038 with litecoin because the bitcoin python library we are using has no litecoin fork yet

From 1.05 to 1.06:
	Moved settings to own database in a better structure, so settings are now seperate from keys
	Added alt coins and cleaned up litecoin key generation.  Was able to remove seperate version of vanitygen for litecoin only.
	Removed sleep from between duplicate wallet printing
